ファイルにメモを残す

add scratch notes for each file

** Usage

Require this script and set a directory to save notes in.

: (require 'scratch-palette)
: (setq scratch-palette-directory "~/.emacs.d/palette/")

Then a command "scratch-palette-popup" is available. This command
displays the note for the file currently editing. If there is no
scratch note yet, a new note is created.

You may close note with one of "C-g", "C-x C-x", or "C-x C-k". Its
contents are automatically saved.
